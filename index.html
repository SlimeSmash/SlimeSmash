    <h1>SlimeSmash Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date: January 2026</strong></p>
    <p>
      SlimeSmash ("we," "our," or "the app") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This policy explains how we collect, use, and handle data in our game.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      SlimeSmash does not collect personal information such as your name, email, address, or phone number.
    </p>
    <p>
      We collect anonymous data for the purpose of improving the game experience:
    </p>
    <p>
      • <strong>Crash logs</strong> — used to detect and fix bugs or crashes.<br>
      • <strong>Diagnostics</strong> — used to monitor app performance and stability.<br>
      • <strong>Other app performance data</strong> — helps us understand how the app runs on different devices.<br>
      • <strong>Device or other IDs</strong> — a random identifier for cloud save and leaderboard functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      All data is collected anonymously and cannot identify individual users.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use the Data</h2>
    <p>
      We use the data collected for:
    </p>
    <p>
      • <strong>Analytics</strong> — to understand how the game is played and how it performs.<br>
      • <strong>Fraud prevention and security</strong> — to detect unusual activity or cheating in leaderboards.<br>
      • <strong>Game improvement</strong> — fixing bugs, improving performance, and enhancing user experience.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share your data with third parties for advertising or other purposes.
    </p>

      The data collected is only sent to Unity Analytics and Unity Cloud Save, which help us monitor and improve the game.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      All data transmitted from your device is encrypted in transit.
    </p>
    <p>
      We follow industry best practices to keep user data secure.

    <h2>5. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, users cannot request deletion of data.
    </p>
    <p>
      All collected data is anonymous and only used for analytics and leaderboard functionality.
    </p>
